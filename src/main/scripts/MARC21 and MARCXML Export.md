# Exporting MARC 21 and MARCXML

From the [Library of Congresse](https://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/)'s introduction to MARC 21 authority data:

> The MARC 21 Format for Authority Data is designed to be a carrier for information concerning the authorized forms 
> of names, subjects, and subject subdivisions to be used in constructing access points in MARC records, the forms 
> of these names, subjects, and subject subdivisions that should be used as references to the authorized forms, and the 
> interrelationships among these forms. A name may be used as a main, added, series, or subject access entry.
